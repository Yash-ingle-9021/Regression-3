    "print(\"Q_7_ANS :- Interpreting the coefficients in Ridge regression requires some consideration due to the regularization effect of the technique. The coefficients in Ridge regression represent the relationship between the independent variables (predictors) and the dependent variable (response), but their interpretation is slightly different from that in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.\\n\\nIn Ridge regression, the coefficients are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared residuals along with a penalty term that discourages large coefficient values. As a result, the coefficients in Ridge regression are shrunk towards zero, and their magnitudes are reduced compared to OLS regression. Here are a few key points to consider when interpreting the coefficients in Ridge regression:\\n\\n1. Magnitude: The magnitude of the coefficients still provides a measure of the strength of the relationship between a predictor and the response variable. Larger absolute coefficient values indicate a stronger impact on the response. However, it's important to note that the magnitude of the coefficients in Ridge regression is generally smaller compared to OLS regression due to the regularization effect.\\n\\n2. Sign: The sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship between the predictor and the response variable.

      "1. Time-series preprocessing: Before applying Ridge regression, it is essential to preprocess the time-series data. This involves addressing any issues related to stationarity, seasonality, and trend. Common preprocessing techniques include differencing, detrending, and deseasonalizing the data to make it more suitable for regression analysis.\n",

The number of lagged predictors to include depends on the specific time dependency and autocorrelation patterns in the data.\n",
